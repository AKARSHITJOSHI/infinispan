/**
 * Extended interface that extends capabilities of writing predefined objects 
 * with the possibility of reading them. Any new externalizer implementations
 * should implement this interface. 
 * 
 * Optionally, Externalizer implementations should implement 
 * {@code ClassTable.ClassReadWritable} when they want to add class information to the 
 * marshalled payload. This is useful in cases where ReadWriter implementations
 * will create, upon read, new instances using reflection.
 * 
 * To add a new non-user Externalizer, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Create an implementation of Externalizer.
 * 
 * 2. Add Class to Externalizer mapping to ConstantObjectTable.EXTERNALIZERS
 * 
 * 3. (Optional) If Externalizer implementation instantiates instances using reflection, 
 * like ReplicableCommandExternalizer, you need to do these further steps on top:
 * 
 * 3.1. You need to write class information to the stream and read it when unmarshalling
 * so that this information can be using during reflection. So, Externalizer implementations 
 * need to implement ClassExternalizer.ClassWritable so that the corresponding ClassExternalizer 
 * is injected.
 * 
 * 3.2 Add Externalizer implementation to the NumberClassExternalizer.MAGIC_NUMBERS list.

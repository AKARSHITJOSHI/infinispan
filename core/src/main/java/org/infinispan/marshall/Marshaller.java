/**
 * A marshaller is a class that is able to marshall and unmarshall objects efficiently.
 * <p/>
 * The reason why this is implemented specially in Infinispan rather than resorting to Java serialization or even the
 * more efficient JBoss serialization is that a lot of efficiency can be gained when a majority of the serialization
 * that occurs has to do with a small set of known types such as {@link org.infinispan.transaction.GlobalTransaction} or
 * {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}, and class type information can be replaced with simple magic
 * numbers.
 * <p/>
 * Unknown types (typically user data) falls back to JBoss serialization.
 * <p/>
 * In addition, using a marshaller allows adding additional data to the byte stream, such as context class loader
 * information on which class loader to use to deserialize the object stream, or versioning information to allow streams
 * to interoperate between different versions of Infinispan (see {@link VersionAwareMarshaller}
 * <p/>
 * This interface is used to marshall {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}s, their parameters and their
 * response values.
 * <p/>
 * The interface is also used by the {@link org.infinispan.loaders.CacheStore} framework to efficiently serialize data
 * to be persisted, as well as the {@link org.infinispan.statetransfer.StateTransferManager} when serializing the cache
 * for transferring state en-masse.
